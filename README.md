# Ecommerce Web App
  This is a simple Ecommerce web application built using Spring Boot, providing user authentication, product management, catalog management, shopping cart 
  functionality, and order management.
  In this project i user Java 8 features, particularly the Stream API and Optional class , for processing data and improving code clarity. The stream API allowed me 
  to perform operations on Collections, such as mapping and filtering, in a concise and efficient manner. The Optional class allowed me to handle null values more 
  safely


## Features
- User Authentication: Secure user registration and login system
- Product and Catalog Management: Manage products and product categories
- Shopping Cart: Add products to cart and manage items 
- Order Management: Manage customer orders
